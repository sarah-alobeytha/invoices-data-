Modern organizations generate large volumes of invoice data that contain valuable financial and operational insights.
Analyzing invoice data helps organizations understand payment behavior, predict future outcomes, and make optimal operational decisions.
This project applies data analytics techniques to a large-scale invoice dataset containing over 500,000 records.
The analysis is divided into three main stages:
Descriptive analytics to explore and summarize invoice data
Predictive analytics to forecast expected payment amounts
Prescriptive analytics to optimize invoice processing costs across multiple centers
